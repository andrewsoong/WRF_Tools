This file describes a series of about one year (already equilibrated)
performed for Eli and Mauricio as initial and boundary conditions for
their WRF experiments. Each run has output every 6 hr. The runs are
numbered 2001-2005 and the output is contained in the directory
/misc/data2_eli/abbot/CAM/. Files describing the location of output
files and their time, for use by Eli's netcdf -> binary program, are
in this directory and are named CAM2WRF-????.input.

Description of runs:

2001 - LO OHT (derived from 1st 10 years of CCSM IPCC 1%/yr to 4XCO2
run) and CO2=280 ppm

2002 - HI OHT (derived from last 10 years of CCSM IPCC 1%/yr to 4XCO2
run) and CO2=1200 ppm

2003 - OHT derived from modern climate, CO2=280 ppm

2004 - OHT derived from modern climate, CO2=1120 ppm

2005 - OHT derived from modern climate, CO2=4480 ppm
