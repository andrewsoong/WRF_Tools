Program v_interp.f

Another bug fix: (9/4/09)

- Another bug is fixed regarding bdy file interpolation. Thanks to 
Jason Evans of University of New South Wales, Australia.

Major bug fix: (5/28/09)

- A bug in interpolating boundary file has been discovered and fixed by Steven Decker
  of Rutgers University. It is now incorporated into the code.

------------

This program may be used to increase number of model vertical levels after wrfinput
and wrfbdy files are obtained. An example for using this program would be after
running program ndown, which horizontally interpolates model data to a finer grid.  

This program reads either wrfinput or wrfbdy files and creates a new
wrfinput and wrfbdy files that have more vertical levels. The number
of new vertical levels (nvert), and the new, full, model levels (nlevels) are 
specified in the namelist.v_interp file. 

A word of caution for adding the new levels: it is the best to add the new full levels
in between the second, and second last full levels in the original set. The program
is not tested for doing any type of extrapolation.


Several compile options are listed near the top of the program v_interp.f.
It requires netcdf library and include file to compile. To run the program, type

./v_interp wrfinput_d01 wrfinput_d01_new

or 

./v_interp wrfbdy_d01 wrfbdy_d01_new

Note that when working with wrfbdy file, the program will key on the name
of the file 'wrfbdy'. So please use wrfbdy file name as it is.
Please also keep the companion wrfinput_d0* file in the same directory,
since the old eta levels need to come from the wrfinput_d0* file.
(Thanks to Steven Decker of Rutgers University for the fix.)
