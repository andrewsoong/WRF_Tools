WRF Objective Analysis Program 

The WRF Objective analysis (OA) program is a program
that blends observations (in the form of ASCII format) and background
(first guess) fields from WPS/metgrid. It provides a simple way to
add observations to the incoming from another model.

For questions and help to run the program, please see the 
User's Guide at http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user_guide/contents.html
