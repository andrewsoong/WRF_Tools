-----------------------------------------------------
Update: January, 2016 V3.8.0
 - Optimize objective analysis and time sorting of obs
 - Add option to scale decreases in RH introduced via the analysis [see option
   scale_cressman_rh_decreases] (Reen et al. 2016; 
   http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0301.1)
 - Surface pressure improvements (improve surface pressure estimation of obs,
   add ability to QC surface pressure obs, add ability to create surface
   pressure objective analysis) [see options qc_psfc and oa_psfc] (Reen 2015; 
   http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA621305)
 - Improve "duplicate" obs merging (prefer ob closest to target time and time of
   merged ob is now time of ob closer to target date)   
 - New littler output files (qc_obs_used_earth_relative*) analogous to
   qc_obs_used* but with earth-relative winds rather than grid-relative winds.
   These can be used as input to the Model Evaluation Tools (MET)
 - Allow smaller radii of influence for surface obs [see setting
   radius_influence_sfc_mult]
 - Single-level above-surface observations (e.g. aircraft obs) can be QC'd 
   against nearby pressure levels in the first guess [see settings 
   use_p_tolerence_one_lev, max_p_tolerance_one_lev_qc, and 
   max_p_tolerance_one_lev_oa]
 - Allow quality control of dewpoint [see settings max_error_dewpoint and 
   max_buddy_dewpoint]
 - Improve consistency of littler output files (make dewpoint consistent with
   temperature and humidity, recalculate wind direction after rotation and
   vertical interpolation of u/v)
 - Allow user to choose to do no analysis (specify analysis type "None")
 - Minor bug fixes 
-----------------------------------------------------
Update: July, 2014 V3.7.0
 - Fix error that caused SLP to be erroneously marked as missing in some cases
 - Add NetCDF version of qc_obs* files
 - Modify compilation to deal with NetCDF changes (add -lnetcdff)
-----------------------------------------------------
Update: April, 2013  V3.4.0
 - Add support for NCAR/MMM observation files which contain unusable
 data that must be ignored (e.g. GPSPW, SATEM, etc.).
 - Allow obs plotting on nested domains.
 - Clean up typos and comments.
-----------------------------------------------------
Update: December, 2012 V3.3.0
 - Add some significant changes to the way the OBS_DOMAINdxx files are written.
 - Add a new qc flag or data that could not be qc-ed due to the fact that the 
   data is off analysis times. The non-qc-ed data can be output if needed.
 - Add some fixes from Brian Reed.
-----------------------------------------------------
Update: April, 2010 V3.2.0
 - Increase search area around each observation, ensuring the banana scheme
   has enough space.
 - minor bug fixes
